# SQL Challenge: Employee Database :technologist:

## Background
The task is to research a project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables
